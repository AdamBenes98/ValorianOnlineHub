    <h2>Constitution of the Kingdom of Valoria</h2>

    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    <p>We, the people of Valoria, united under our King and loyal within the Unite Union of Republics (UUR), establish this Constitution to preserve our sovereignty, ensure justice and security, and uphold the Valorian spirit of trade, neutrality, and civic participation. Valoria seeks to be a stable middle power — focused on commerce, alliances, and pragmatic diplomacy while remaining loyal to the UUR when collective defense is required.</p>

    <h3>Article I — Valoria and the UUR</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Valoria is a proud and semi-autonomous realm within the Unite Union of Republics (UUR).</li>
      <li>Valoria remains a member of the UUR. Valoria's default posture is to act as a neutral, trade-focused intermediary ("the middle") that cultivates alliances and commerce with multiple partners, provided such relations do not conflict with UUR obligations.</li>
      <li>In matters of UUR collective defense, Valoria will ordinarily honor its commitments to the UUR; however the internal governance mechanisms (see Article II and Article V) provide for considered decision-making before committing Valorian forces to offensive operations outside its borders.</li>
      <li>Valoria maintains the right to negotiate bilateral trade and alliance agreements (for example, free trade arrangements with the Astari) so long as they do not violate explicit UUR treaties to which Valoria is party.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Article II — Autonomy, Power-sharing, and Governance</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Valoria retains broad autonomy over domestic affairs including law, economy, and local administration, consistent with UUR fundamental principles.</li>
      <li>Valoria's executive authority is shared among three constitutional offices that together form the Valorian Regional Council (VRC):</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>The King</strong> — holds the decisive interest equivalent to 50% of the Council influence and acts as Head of State and guardian of Valorian unity.</li>
        <li><strong>The Lord of Valoria</strong> — a fixed lordship holding 25% influence in the VRC</li>
        <li><strong>The Senior Lord of Valoria</strong> — a fixed lordship holding 25% influence in the VRC</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The VRC votes on major constitutional matters and on whether a citizen referendum (popular vote) should be opened for issues of national importance. A majority of the Council is required for most decisions; certain constitutional questions may require a supermajority (see Article XI).</li>
      <li>The Valorian Regional Council (VRC) is also the legislative body. To reflect Valoria's current size and practice, the VRC shall be constituted of three (3) appointed/elected members unless otherwise expanded by constitutional amendment. The VRC deliberates and drafts legislation, subject to VRC and Crown approval as defined herein.</li>
      <li>Citizen political participation: citizens retain the right to petition, propose initiatives, and request referenda. An initiative signed by a threshold proportion of citizens (set by law) triggers VRC consideration and requires the VRC to vote on whether to allow a public referendum. This provides a formal pathway for citizens to influence policy beyond passive observation.</li>
      <li>Alter Hafen: the city of Alter Hafen enjoys recognized, limited autonomy owing to its multi-national founding. It is governed locally by a fixed Lord (Lord of Alter Hafen) with powers delegated in municipal statute. Alter Hafen operates under Valorian sovereignty but retains local rule over municipal affairs and trade administration.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Article II.X — Lordships for New Cities</h3>
      <ol>
     <li>When a new city is officially recognized by the King, a lordship may be established to oversee local administration, projects, and initiatives.</li>
     <li>Citizens of the Kingdom of Valoria shall participate in a one-time vote between three current members of the Valorian Regional Council (VRC), to determine which official shall serve as Lord of the city.</li>
     <li>The elected Lord shall hold office over the city until reassignment, and shall be responsible for managing local administrative matters, reporting to the King as necessary.</li>
     <li>Lordship does not confer additional VRC influence, alter the fixed VRC shares, or affect the constitutional authority of the elected official at the national level.</li>
     <li>The VRC and King may enact regulations detailing the procedural, statutory, and administrative aspects of the lordships.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Article III — Rights and Duties of Citizens</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>All citizens are equal before the law and enjoy fundamental rights to safety, freedom of expression, property, and fair trial.</li>
      <li>Employment, civic contribution, and participation are encouraged as duties of citizenship; the State shall provide avenues for meaningful, proportionate service.</li>
      <li>Citizens have the right to bear arms for defense of the realm subject to regulation and training requirements set by law.</li>
      <li>The government may take exceptional measures in times of war or national emergency in accordance with Article XV (emergency review).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Article IV — Economy, Trade, and Neutrality</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Valoria's policy prioritizes commerce, innovation, and fair trade. The realm seeks to be a regional trading hub and mediator.</li>
      <li>Valorian and allied enterprises are given preference in domestic procurement where appropriate; however treaty obligations and fair competition rules shall be respected.</li>
      <li>Valoria formally recognizes the legitimacy of negotiated free trade agreements (such as with the Astari). Trade agreements may be entered into by the VRC with VRC oversight to ensure consistency with UUR commitments.</li>
      <li>Neutrality policy: Valoria will avoid participation in offensive conflicts where possible, seeking to remain the neutral middle. If UUR collective defense compels participation, the VRC shall guide implementation to preserve Valorian interests and citizen safety.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Article V — Security, Defense and the Citizen Army</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The defense of Valoria is a shared responsibility. The Valorian Internal Service (VIS) maintains domestic order and supports civil defense; a trained citizen militia/army exists for territorial defense.</li>
      <li>Mobilization for external campaigns shall follow VRC and VRC procedures; where possible, Valoria emphasizes defensive readiness and avoiding entanglement in external power struggles.</li>
      <li>The VIS and Valorian forces coordinate with the UUR for joint defense obligations, subject to the VRC's guidance and citizen safeguards.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Article VI — Culture, Identity and Local Autonomy</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Valorian culture, language, and heritage shall be preserved and promoted.</li>
      <li>Other cultures are respected within Valoria and in Alter Hafen's multicultural administration, provided they do not seek to undermine Valorian constitutional order.</li>
      <li>Acts intended to provoke unrest through cultural mockery are discouraged and may be addressed within the bounds of law and proportionality.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Article VII — Treason, Loyalty and Public Office</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Officials and citizens sworn into office shall pledge loyalty to Valoria and respect Valorian obligations to the UUR.</li>
      <li>Treason, rebellion, or deliberate acts of subversion against Valoria or the UUR are prosecutable under Valorian law.</li>
      <li>The VRC has the constitutional authority to review alleged breaches by officials; adjudication remains the remit of the independent courts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Article VIII — The Rule of Law & Judicial Independence</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>All citizens and officials are bound by this Constitution.</li>
      <li>Laws may be enacted by the VRC and require formal assent as defined in statute and VRC procedures.</li>
      <li>The judiciary shall remain independent and ensure due process, proportionality, and transparency.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Article IX — Amendments and Citizen Referenda</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>This Constitution may be amended by a two-thirds majority of the VRC and approval by the King, or by constitutional process initiated via citizen referendum when permitted by the VRC.</li>
      <li>For major structural changes (including alteration of VRC composition or core sovereignty clauses), a supermajority in the VRC and a citizen referendum are required.</li>
      <li>Procedures for citizen initiatives, thresholds, and referendum administration shall be detailed in implementing statute.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Article X — Implementation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>This Constitution takes precedence over ordinary statute. Transitional provisions shall be enacted to reflect the VRC power distribution and the three-member VRC composition described herein.</li>
    </ol>
