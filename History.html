                        Before memory, the land of Valmyra lay sleeping - a canvas of crystalline ice and shadowed forests.

                    <div class="timeline-details">
                        In the aeons before time, Valthar, the eternal Watcher, guarded the primordial expanse. Neither of land nor sky, he was presence itself - an incorporeal consciousness intertwined with Valmyra since its first molecule coalesced from cosmic dust. Through the Fire of Valmyra, a geothermal heart burning beneath the frozen surface, he shaped the destiny of the sleeping world with infinite patience.

                        They came seeking refuge, ill-suited to the harshness of the Land. The cold bit at their exposed skin, winds tore at their shelters, and long dark nights filled them with ancestral dread. Valthar perceived in their eyes a different light - a spark of curiosity, ambition, and deep emotion. During the deepest hours, he drew upon the Fire of Valmyra to radiate gentle warmth beneath their shelters, ensuring the spark of life within them would not extinguish.

                        Years turned to decades. The settlement transformed as Valthar subtly smoothed jagged surfaces and shifted massive boulders while they slept. The people marveled at their fortune, speaking of the "spirit of the land" being kind to them. Their village grew into Valor - a beacon of warmth and light in the vast cold. Stone walls rose as bulwarks against harsh elements, markets bustled, and the first council of elders formed the kingdom's foundation.

                        Centuries passed. The kingdom of Valoria had taken root with Valor as its shining capital. Valthar, witnessing generations born and pass away, saw his role as silent guardian drawing to a natural close. He vowed to retreat entirely, returning only if Valoria faced a problem that threatened to unravel their very existence. His departure would be as silent as his presence - only a gradual fading of imperceptible warmth would mark the transition.

                    <div class="timeline-details">
                        In his withdrawal, Valthar felt the Valorians' need for connection and guidance. From their courage, resilience, and the Fire of Valmyra, he conceived Detlef - not through mortal means but through intricate weaving of spiritual energy. Born to a stonemason and weaver who had longed for a child, Detlef carried Valthar's whispers as thoughts and gentle guidance resonating within his soul, destined to become the kingdom's first martyr.

                        Leading the great undertaking into the Underground, Detlef discovered caverns of remarkable warmth that could shelter many during harsh winters. But fate struck cruelly - a mysterious fire erupted in the connecting tunnels. As smoke choked the passages and panic ensued, Detlef remained a beacon of calm, guiding his companions toward escape. When the heat destabilized the rock above and tons of earth collapsed, sealing their fate, Detlef gathered the trapped men, speaking of purpose and community until the last breath of air gave way to smoke and flame.

                        On the first anniversary of the tragedy, as people gathered at Detlef's monument, a strange light emanated from the sealed Underground. From the illuminated opening emerged Valseran - tall and robed, with features reminiscent of Detlef but imbued with ageless wisdom and serene authority. "The work begun in shadow must be completed in light," he proclaimed. "Detlef's sacrifice was not in vain. I am Valseran, and I have come to help you walk the path he opened."

The state security apparatus (VIS) identified and suppressed dissent, making criticism of government the worst crime. Despite severe restrictions, this era achieved exceptional social cohesion, zero recorded crime, and forged the modern Valorian identity. Citizens greeted each other with "Sieg Valoria," cementing the unofficial "Valorian Reich" legacy.

The trend exploded after he gifted a pair to Emperor Adam, who wore them regularly. These durable boots became cultural staples for miners and outdoor workers, eventually symbolizing Valorian strength and tradition. All Valorian netherite boots became commonly known as "Springerstiefel," representing the people's resilience and connection to their land.

The state facilitated acquisition of netherite armor and weapons for all citizens, distributing countless Springerstiefel in the process. This policy transformed every Valorian into a potential defender, creating a nation where the line between civilian and soldier blurred, ensuring that any invader would face an entire armed populace.

Seeking stronger partnerships, Valoria sold some Land to the Astari for millions and the Valorka wine, generating massive economic boost. Dwayne of the Astari became Valoria's biggest investor, injecting over 10 million into the economy. This period saw creation of Valoria's national flag and establishment of the Valorian Franc currency through the newly built Valorian National Bank.

                        During growth period, Valoria faced renewed racism from Elytheria, perceived as unprovoked by Valorians. This rivalry led to creation of the term "Con-Valo" for those who insulted the nation. The tension finally resolved when Valoria's ally, Dwayne, won the Elytherian elections and became its new King, ushering in an era of peace between the historically opposed nations and cementing Valoria's diplomatic triumph.
